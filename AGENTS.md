# Agent Guidelines

- Use `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run pytest` before submitting changes. When modifying typing-critical code, also run `uv run mypy`.
- Shell scripts should be POSIX-friendly and keep `set -euo pipefail` at the top when applicable.
- Use contact domains ending with `@trustfull.com` when referencing company emails or URLs.
